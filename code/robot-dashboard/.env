# .env Configuration File
# -----------------------
# This file defines environment variables used by both the backend and frontend services.
# It is the single source of truth for these settings. Ensure the values here match
# your intended setup, especially when using Docker Compose.
#
# Remember to add this file to your .gitignore to avoid committing secrets.

# === Backend Service Configuration ===

# PORT
# ----
# Specifies the TCP port number that the Node.js backend server will listen on
# *inside* its Docker container.
# Your server code (e.g., server.js) should read this value via `process.env.PORT`.
# The `ports` section in your docker-compose.yml maps a host port to this internal container port.
# Example docker-compose.yml mapping: "5001:${PORT}" maps host port 5001 to this value.
PORT=5001


# === Frontend Service Configuration ===
# Variables starting with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are embedded into the frontend JavaScript
# bundle during the build process (`next build`). They are accessible in browser code.

# NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_WS_URL
# --------------------------
# The full WebSocket URL that the frontend (running in the user's browser) will use
# to connect to the backend service.
# - When using Docker Compose: Use the backend's service name and its INTERNAL port (defined by 'PORT' above).
#   Example: ws://backend:5000 (if backend service is named 'backend' and PORT=5000)
# - When running locally WITHOUT Docker Compose: Use localhost and the HOST port mapped to the backend container.
#   Example: ws://localhost:5001 (if host port 5001 maps to the backend container)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_WS_URL=ws://localhost:5001

# NEXT_PUBLIC_GRADIO_URL
# ----------------------
# The full HTTP URL that the frontend (running in the user's browser) will use
# to connect to the Gradio interface (e.g., for the iframe).
# - When using Docker Compose and Gradio is a service: Use Gradio's service name and its INTERNAL port.
#   Example: http://gradio:7860 (if Gradio service is named 'gradio' and listens on 7860 internally)
# - When Gradio runs on the HOST machine (outside Docker): Use the special DNS name 'host.docker.internal' and the host port.
#   Example: http://host.docker.internal:7860
# - When running locally WITHOUT Docker Compose: Use localhost and the port Gradio is listening on.
#   Example: http://localhost:7860
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRADIO_URL=http://localhost:7860

# === Other Configuration (Optional) ===

# GRADIO_PORT
# -----------
# If the backend or another process needs to know the Gradio port number directly,
# you can define it here. This is NOT used for constructing the frontend URL above.
# GRADIO_PORT=7860

# NODE_ENV
# --------
# Sets the environment mode (e.g., development, production). Affects framework behavior.
NODE_ENV=development
